## Installation

### Option 1: Add the Official Slackelo Bot to Your Workspace

1. Visit [https://andri.io/slackelo](https://andri.io/slackelo)
2. Click "Add to Slack"
3. Authorize the app for your workspace
4. Invite @Slackelo to any channels where you want to use it

Do note that the official Slackelo bot relies on my server, which might not be available someday. If you want to ensure that the bot is always available, consider self-hosting it.

### Option 2: Self-Host Slackelo

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite 3
- A publicly accessible URL for OAuth redirects (can use ngrok for testing)

#### Step 1: Create a Slack App

2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. Name your app (e.g., "Slackelo") and select your workspace
5. Click "Create App"

#### Step 2: Configure Slack App Settings

1. Under "Basic Information", note your Signing Secret
2. Under "OAuth & Permissions":

   - Add the following Bot Token Scopes:
     - `channels:history`
     - `chat:write`
     - `commands`
   - Set your Redirect URL: `https://your-domain.com/oauth/redirect`

3. Under "Slash Commands", create the following commands:

   - `/game`
   - `/simulate`
   - `/leaderboard`
   - `/rating`
   - `/history`
   - `/kfactor`
   - `/gamble`
   - `/stats`
   - `/chart`
   - `/undo`
   - `/help`

   For each command, use `https://your-domain.com/slack/commands` as the Request URL

4. Under "Interactivity & Shortcuts":

   - Set the Request URL to `https://your-domain.com/events`

5. Install the app to your workspace from the "Install App" section

#### Step 3: Clone and Configure Slackelo

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndri/slackelo.git
   cd slackelo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your Slack app credentials and configuration:

   ```
   # Database configuration
   DB_PATH=slackelo.db
   INIT_SQL_FILE=init.sql

   # Slack API credentials
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id
   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret

   # OAuth and installation settings

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Your Slackelo bot should now be running and accessible at `https://your-domain.com`

#### Deployment Options

For production deployment, consider serving Slackelo using a WSGI server like Gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx.

Here is the guide I followed to deploy it: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04

## How Elo Ratings Work

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing player. The number of points exchanged depends on the rating difference between players:

- When a higher-rated player beats a lower-rated player, relatively few points are exchanged
- When a lower-rated player beats a higher-rated player, more points are exchanged

The K-factor determines how dramatically ratings change after each game:

- Higher K-factor (e.g., 64): Ratings change more quickly
- Lower K-factor (e.g., 16): Ratings change more slowly
- Default K-factor: 32
